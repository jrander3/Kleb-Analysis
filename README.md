# Klebsiella ARG Analysis Project

This repository contains scripts and summary data for analyzing antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in clinical and environmental Klebsiella isolates using BLASTX against the CARD database.

## Contents

- ARG detection & matrix generation
- Statistical enrichment (Fisher's test)
- ARG class breakdowns
- Co-occurrence, PCA, and phylogenetic analysis (RAxML)

## Input

Input data (FASTQs, contigs, and `.blast.out` files) were processed on the Bridges2 HPC cluster and are not included in this repo.

## Scripts

All Python scripts are modular and self-contained for reproducibility.
